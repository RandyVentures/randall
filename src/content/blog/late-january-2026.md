Finally got my iOS app live on my phone. Paid for the developer account, installed it, and I'm officially using it to track my rental properties for 2026. There's something satisfying about shipping something you've been building - even if the only user for now is me.

The app is tracking everything I need it to. Next step is polishing it up and getting it on the App Store to actually sell. But for now, it's real. It's working. That's progress.

## The Unglamorous Side of Rentals

Meanwhile, had to deal with one of those "fun" rental moments this week. Kids at one of my properties decided rocks belonged in a pipe. They don't. Cue emergency plumber call to unclog the whole thing.

This is the stuff they don't talk about in the "passive income" YouTube videos. Rental properties aren't passive when you're coordinating plumbers at odd hours and wondering what else might be lodged somewhere it shouldn't be.

Fixed now. But a good reminder that property management is very much active work.

## The Work Grind (and the Light at the End)

Had some solid productive calls recently. Lots of good work happening, but also lots of work I need to get ahead on. It's that weird zone where you're grateful things are moving but also very aware you could use a breather.

Looking forward to a day off. Actually looking forward to it.

On the bright side: looks like I've got a work trip coming up in February or early March, and there's a chance I might get to go skiing. Haven't been in a while, so that's something to look forward to. Sometimes the best productivity hack is just having something fun on the calendar.

## Thoughts

It's been a solid month so far. Shipped an app I'm actually using. Dealt with the chaos of rental management. Stayed on top of work even when it's relentless. And I've got a ski trip on the horizon.

Not every week needs to be transformative. Sometimes it's just about showing up, handling what comes, and keeping things moving forward.
