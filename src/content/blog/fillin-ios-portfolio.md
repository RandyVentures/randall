Wordle captured something special—simple mechanic, daily ritual, instant feedback. **Fillin** takes that energy and applies it to "fill in the blank" style word puzzles. Think sentences with missing words, not letter grids.

## The Portfolio Play

I just signed up for Figma and committed to publishing iOS apps regularly. Not chasing viral success or massive downloads—I'm here for **reps**.

As a principal engineer, I build complex systems at work every day. But iOS development? That's a different muscle. Shipping small, polished apps teaches:

- **UI/UX thinking** → Figma designs to SwiftUI code
- **App Store mechanics** → Publishing flow, metadata, screenshots
- **Scope management** → Keep it simple, ship it fast
- **Design polish** → Making things feel good to use

Every app is practice: design, develop, deploy. Repeat.

## Why Fillin First?

Word games are constrained enough to ship quickly but interesting enough to learn from. The core loop is straightforward:
1. Show a sentence with a blank
2. Player fills in the missing word
3. Instant feedback

Simple to build. Hard to perfect. Perfect for learning.

## The Figma → Xcode Flow

This is my first project using Figma for design before code. I'm deliberately building a workflow:
- Design screens and interactions in Figma
- Prototype the flow before writing SwiftUI
- Iterate on design faster than code allows
- Ship when it feels right, not when it's "done"

It's not about perfection. It's about building the habit of shipping.

## What's Next

Design in Figma. Build in Xcode. Ship to the App Store. Repeat.

Fillin is #1. More will follow.

This isn't a side hustle—it's skill-building in public. Every app adds to the portfolio. Every launch teaches something new.

Let's see where this goes.
