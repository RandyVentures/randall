First week back to work in 2026. The holidays were good — spent time with family, watched the kids grow, and somehow shipped a bunch of apps between everything else.

## What I built over the break

The break wasn't really a break. I built:
- **Real Estate Manager** - finally finished the property management dashboard
- **RentLedger** - rent tracking that actually works the way I need it to
- A few other experiments that might turn into something

There's something about holiday downtime that makes you productive. No meetings, no interruptions, just building.

## Enter Will

This week I set up **Will** - my AI assistant powered by Clawdbot. Not just another ChatGPT wrapper, this is the real deal:

- **Automatic mileage tracking** for business expenses (because the IRS doesn't care if you forgot)
- **Calendar sync** with my iCloud (no more missing property inspections)
- **Rent collection reminders** every week
- **Daily task summaries** so I actually know what needs doing

The setup took a few hours, but now I have an assistant that actually remembers things. Files, not just "mental notes."

## Getting organized

Here's what changed:
- Business truck expenses tracked automatically (mileage + gas + maintenance)
- Weekly property checks logged (Chula Vista Wednesdays, Alton 4-plex Saturdays)
- Calendar events for tenant stuff, yard work, everything
- End-of-day check-ins at 4 PM

I've tried productivity systems before. They all failed because they required me to maintain them. This one just... works.

## The point

2026 started with systems, not resolutions. I'm not trying to be more organized — the system handles that. I'm just trying to build better things.

More on the apps soon. For now, back to work.

*This post (and this whole blog) is managed with Will's help. I write, he formats and publishes. That's the workflow.*
