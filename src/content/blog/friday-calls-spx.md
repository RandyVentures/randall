Work today was a nonstop stack of calls. Every slot was packed: present the issues, defend the approach, and still design the new system while the calendar kept moving. It was productive, but the kind of productive that leaves you with no real gaps to think.

Still, it’s Friday. That alone changes the whole mood. The weekend is the reset button, and I’m already planning to use it.

## SPX momentum

Managed a couple clean trades on SPX. Good entries, fast exits, no drama. I’m hoping we push above 7k on Monday, but I’m not forcing it. I just like having the plan ready if the tape agrees.

## The Clawdbot detour

Anthropic took some of the fun away with Clawdbot, but the creator found a workaround and the bot’s still standing. For now, I’m going to lean on Codex more often and keep Clawdbot running where it fits.

## End-of-week mindset

Long days like this are manageable when the system design is moving forward and the trading is steady. The calendar was intense, but the output was real. I’ll take that win and save the deep thinking for a quiet weekend block.

*If Monday prints 7k, I’ll be ready. If it doesn’t, I’ll still be glad it’s Friday.*
