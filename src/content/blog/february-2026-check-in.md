Packed week. Let's get into it.

## Catalyst Is Live (App #3)

Shipped another one. **Catalyst** is my third iOS app and it's currently pending App Store review. Three apps in a relatively short window — that's the portfolio strategy working.

Each app teaches something different. Fillin was about word game mechanics. This one pushed me further. Figma to Xcode, design to ship, repeat. The reps are adding up.

## Productive Week at Work

Solid week on the engineering side. Not every week needs a highlight reel — sometimes it's just about steady output and staying ahead of the queue. This was one of those weeks.

## Kids Wonderland Saturday

Took the kids out Saturday to a kids wonderland place. Days like that are the reminder of why everything else matters. You can have all the productivity in the world, but watching your kids light up in a place built for them hits different.

Worth every minute away from the keyboard.

## Church Today

Today's lesson landed. The message was about money — specifically, that it shouldn't be the priority. Keep giving to the offering, but the real ask is to give more of yourself: your time, your presence, your involvement.

That's the harder ask. Time is the thing we always say we don't have enough of. But that's usually the thing that's needed most.

It's a good reminder. Stay involved. Show up.

## Tres Lagos Move on the Horizon

Been thinking seriously about moving to Tres Lagos — rent there while we continue saving to buy or build in 2027. It's a strategic move. Keep the plan intact, stay disciplined on the savings side, and set up for the right long-term decision rather than rushing into something now.

More on this as it develops.

## Super Bowl Sunday BBQ

Capping the week off right — Super Bowl today, BBQ at the house, whole family invited. That's the kind of Sunday you don't overthink. Fire up the grill, enjoy the company, let the week breathe.

Good week. Shipped an app. Spent time with the kids. Got some perspective at church. Plans are moving. Now go watch some football.
