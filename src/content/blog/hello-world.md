Welcome to Randall - my space to share thoughts on code, business, and life.

I'm Randy Torres, building in South Texas. Real estate investor, developer, and always learning.

## What to expect here

This blog is where I'll share:
- **Code & tech** - projects I'm building, things I'm learning
- **Business** - lessons from managing rental properties and running ventures
- **Thoughts** - whatever's on my mind

No schedule, no pressure. Just real updates when there's something worth sharing.
