Today was a marathon: calls back to back, no real breaks. Still managed to ship a new version of my AI automated release-notes summary process. It's tighter now and trims the noisy bits so the final recap is cleaner.

## Highlights

- Found out I'm the dedicated AI architect now. Same pace, more ownership.
- Kids are all finally back in school, which means the house is quiet again.
- Another PR landed in Clawdbot. This one references the Telegram HTML parsing cleanup we did and keeps that flow solid. **[PR #435](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/pull/435)**.

Even on a long day, a real automation win and a merged PR is a good combo.
